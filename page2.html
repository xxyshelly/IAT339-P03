                    <p class="project_intro">Our animation “Cactus and Hedgehog” is about a cactus who is a new friend of the garden
and is excited to make friends with Sunflower and Dandelion who live in the garden for quite a
long time. However, Sunflower and Dandelion are having a prejudice against the Cactus when
they saw the spines grown on cactus. And the situation even gets worse as later the flora seeds of
Dandelion have been hooked by the spines on Cactus, the cactus, therefore, has been disliked by
them. Cactus is hurt and hates the spines, then the Cactus tries to get rid of the spines in order to
cater to them but the result is not good that Sunflower and Dandelion laugh at him and the spines
will grow back. The story changed until the hedgehog, who is willing to make friends with the
cactus, visits the garden and teaches the cactus how to get along with them as well as the fact that
it is no need to change ourselves in order to cater to others.<br> (Team size: 5 /

                        Our team is interested in cute and exaggerated cartoon styles, especially the one personalizing plants, non-human animals, or objects. Here are some examples of our preferred style. Here's our research for the precedences. CGI Animated Short Film "Barely There" by Hannah Lee | CGMeetup.

                    <p> A spacious open-air backyard filled with colourful blooming flowers. Bunches of bushes circulated around the brown fences of the garden. A footpath is located in the garden. There are two flower beds with fertile soil to nourish the growth of varied plants. A table with two chairs are set in the yard. The sun is shining brightly in the daytime with a warm breeze whisper through the bushes.

                    <p>
                       I modelled, textured and rigged the hedgehog model. I used extrude, vertex, face tools etc. for
                        modelling. I used the UV map to apply the texture of the hedgehog drawn by myself. During the
                        rigging part, I used the plugin rigging software called advanced skeleton 5.240。
                        For the animation part, I animated from 1:08s to 1:33s.

        <h2>Stage 4 - Project imperatives</h2>
                    <p>
                        The essential element for our project to finish successfully is team communication. Our team has
excellent communication skill, each of our group members is active to provide different
brainstorming ideas and willing to help each other when someone faces problems in their own
parts. The group chat has offered a place that each of us is able to give useful feedback and
suggestions objectively. Good team communication helps us set up the directions of the
animation script at the very beginning and also facility us to follow the team schedule strictly so
that we can finish our modelling early and have enough time to revise and animate.

                    <p>
                        Through the presentation of our final project, we have learned how to model, rig, texture
characters and scene in Maya. We have experienced each stage of animation making including
modelling, texturing, rigging, lighting, animating, rendering and editing. And each of us has
finished nicely and all of us work together to present the final animation. In this course, we have
gained the experience of working with groups and found out the process of making animation is
complicated and requires collaboration. And teamwork is the most essential element for the
completion of the animation.
