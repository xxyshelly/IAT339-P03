                        The animation “Cactus and Hedgehog” is a two-mins animation that tells the story between a cactus and a hedgehog in the
                        garden. The story is originated from nominated animation Pins and Needles (2018), we have
                        changed a little bit from the original script to make sure it will fit the overall project
                        development. We have split the animation process into modelling, rigging, animating, rendering. The animation consists of environment
                        modelling and four character modelling. We have assigned evenly those five parts to our team
                        members. After all of us finished the modelling, we have combined them all in one scene and set
                        up the lighting for the later animation.</p>

                        Highlights/Challenges</h3>
                    <p class="project_detail">
                        When we start to consider the facial expression of each character, we
have found that extruding the “real eyes, mouth, eyebrow, etc.” might not meet the aesthetic
standard of our animation and lack of the cartoon style that we want. So we decided to use
animating texture to present all character beautifully, by drawing ahead all the facial expressions
of each character and added them as an attribute of each character so we don’t have to click the
UV map window for each frame.

                    then the Cactus tries to get rid of the spines in order to cater to them but the
                    result is not good that Sunflower and Dandelion laugh at him and the spines will
                    grow back. The story changed until the hedgehog, who is willing to make friends

modelling. I used the UV map to apply the texture of the hedgehog drawn by myself. During the
rigging part, I used the plugin rigging software called advanced skeleton 5.240

                    Through the story of cactus and hedgehog, our team wants to deliver the information that
sometimes, it might be hard to make people around to accept and appreciate you and it might
result in self-abasement and questioning ourselves. However, it does not mean that you are not
good and you don’t have to let everyone like you. Instead, you will find friends elsewhere that
can understand you without letting you change anything of yourself.
