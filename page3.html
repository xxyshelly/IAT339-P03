his is a group project about a horror film where a girl tries on a necklace she orders. As time
passes, strange things begin to happen. We spent a month f rom creating the script to filming
and later editing the video.
A
fter the project was assigned, my group members and I started brainstorming about the
theme and types we will do. We created an idea bank on google docs and vote for the best
idea. I sugges t ed my members to use a horror theme, as I researched the past SIAT projects,
I found not many teams would work on horror theme as it has high demands on the design
of scenery, sound, and graphics. I t could be a challenge for us but also an opportunity. Si nce
this is one of the few film classes we get to experience in SIAT, I hope d we could get out of
our comfort zone and produce a triumphant piece My team members agreed, and I ended
up taking on the role of primary screenwriter.<br> (Team size: 4 /

                    <p>
                        After a large
amount time of researching, as well as considered about the time and technical
we had, I got some inspirations from “ A Social Life ” and Ghost pass by ”. In my initial thoughts,
I designed the scenario to discuss the horrors that arise from the relationship between social
media and human nature like Social Media Depression. It's about a girl who loves taking
selfies and posting them everywhere she goes every time she uses her phone, she saw a
ghost behind and getting closer

                        rst and then we started to make a draft story broad and discuss
                        about the film log we would film with . To be precise about the timeline, I created a production
                        schedule to make sure we are on the right track on each step.

                    <p>
                        I think the key to our success is that we communicate very promptly and accurately. As the
promoter of the whole project, I have a very strict control over the time, in time we had a
huge amount of tasks, we still completed all the work. At the same time, at the end of each
shoot, I would call a small meeting to summarize the day's accomplishments and areas for
improvement, so our teamwork was very harmonious. During the production process, I paid
great attention to the audience's thoughts and feelings, esp ecially during the final revision
process, I asked a lot of friends for feedback, so that they could tell me how they feel the pace
and style of the whole film and I can make adjustments on time

                    <p>
                        Through the presentation of our final project, we have learned how to model, rig, texture
characters and scene in Maya. We have experienced each stage of animation making including
modelling, texturing, rigging, lighting, animating, rendering and editing. And each of us has
finished nicely and all of us work together to present the final animation. In this course, we have
gained the experience of working with groups and found out the process of making animation is
complicated and requires collaboration. And teamwork is the most essential element for the
completion of the animation.
