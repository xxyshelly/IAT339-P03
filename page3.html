                        Our animation “Cactus and Hedgehog” is about a cactus who is a new friend of the
                        garden and is excited to make friends with Sunflower and Dandelion who live in the
                        garden for quite a long time. However, Sunflower and Dandelion are having a prejudice
                        against the Cactus when they saw the spines grown on cactus. And the situation even
                        gets worse as later the flora seeds of Dandelion have been hooked by the spines
                        on Cactus, the cactus, therefore, has been disliked by them. Cactus is hurt and
                        hates the spines, then the Cactus tries to get rid of the spines in order to cater
                        to them but the result is not good that Sunflower and Dandelion laugh at him and
                        the spines will grow back. The story changed until the hedgehog, who is willing
                        to make friends with the cactus, visits the garden and teaches the cactus how to
                        get along with them as well as the fact that it is no need to change ourselves in
                        order to cater to others.</p>

                        The new member of the plant family in the garden, shy and lack of confidence, is willing to make friends with the rest of the plant family like sunflower and dandelion. Unfortunately, the spines of itself scare away the other plants, no plant would like to touch it as the fear of being injured. The self-abasement growing from its heart pushes it to cater to the image of other plants and pull out the spines from itself. However, it didn’t help winning over other friends, instead, more laughing at towards it. The story changed until the coming of a cute visitor...</p>

                            result is not good that Sunflower and Dandelion laugh at him and the spines will
                            grow back. The story changed until the hedgehog, who is willing to make friends

                            to others.
